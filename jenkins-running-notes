--------############# CICD #############---------------
--------------------------------------------------

what is CICD?

In software engineering, CI/CD or CICD is the combined practices of continuous integration and continuous delivery or, less often, continuous deployment. They are sometimes referred to collectively as continuous development or continuous software development

Why Jenkins? 

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).

It is an open-source tool with great community support.
It is easy to install.
It has 1000+ plugins to ease your work. If a plugin does not exist, you can code it and share it with the community.
It is free of cost.
It is built with Java and hence, it is portable to all the major platforms.
Inventor: kohsuke kawaguchi
its a free and open-source tool.
jenkins written on java.
it can automate entire sdlc.
it is owned by sun micro system as hudson.
hudson is paid version.
later oracle brought hudson and make it free.
later hudson was renamed as jenkins.



jenkins runs on 8080 port

-------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------Triggers-------------------------

In Jenkins, a build trigger is a mechanism that initiates the execution of a Jenkins job or pipeline. Triggers are used to start builds automatically based on various events or conditions. There are several ways to trigger builds in Jenkins:

Manual Build Trigger:

Build Now: You can manually trigger a build at any time by clicking the “Build Now” or “Build” button on the Jenkins dashboard for a specific job. This is useful for ad-hoc or on-demand builds.
Scheduled Build Trigger:

Build Periodically: You can schedule builds to run at specific intervals using the “Build periodically” option in the job configuration. You can use cron syntax to define the schedule. For example, to run a build every night at 2:00 AM, you can use the cron expression 0 2 * * *.
SCM (Source Code Management) Trigger:

Poll SCM: If you’re using a version control system (e.g., Git, Subversion), you can configure the job to poll the repository for changes. When changes are detected, Jenkins will automatically trigger a build. This is known as the “Poll SCM” build trigger.
Webhooks Trigger:

Webhooks: Many version control systems and external services support webhooks, which allow them to notify Jenkins when code changes occur. Jenkins can listen for these webhook notifications and trigger builds in response.
Dependency Build Trigger:

Build after other projects are built: You can configure a job to be triggered after one or more upstream jobs have been built successfully. This is useful for creating build pipelines or ensuring that certain prerequisites are met before starting a build.
Parameterized Build Trigger:

ex: Job1------job2-----job3

here job1 upstream is job2
     job2 downstream is Job1
     job2 upstream is Job3
     job3 downstream is job2

so whenever jb1 triggers after that job2 will trigeere agter that job3 will trigger 

if any one downstream job fail means necxt upstream job will not success 

Trigger builds with parameters: You can set up parameterized builds where a build is triggered with specific parameter values. This is useful for customizing builds based on input parameters.
Pipeline Trigger:

Pipeline Trigger: If you’re using Jenkins Pipelines (defined in a Jenkinsfile), you can use various triggers within the pipeline script itself. For example, you can set up a webhook trigger, a schedule trigger, or a manual input trigger as part of your pipeline script.
Remote API Trigger:


Jenkins has numerous plugins available that can provide additional trigger mechanisms. For example, the “GitHub Webhook” plugin allows Jenkins to listen to GitHub events and trigger builds accordingly.
The choice of build trigger method depends on your specific use case and requirements.

-----------------------------------------------
approach 3: 


Note:   


#created jenkins file uploded into github

#we can run job by calling above jenkins file in git hub 

--To Implement 

give GITHUB url and in defination section we need to "sleect pipeline script from scm" option and build the job
#Jenkins file

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
    
        stage ("terraform init") {
            steps {
                sh ("terraform init -reconfigure") 
            }
        }
        
        stage ("plan") {
            steps {
                sh ('terraform plan') 
            }
        }

        stage (" Action") {
            steps {
                echo "Terraform action is --> ${action}"
                sh ('terraform ${action} --auto-approve') 
           }
        }
    }
}
 

==================================================================
#### Jenkins version upgrade and downgrade ####

jenkins --version

cd /usr/share/java

rm -rf jenkins.war

to download new version war ---> https://updates.jenkins.io/download/war/

take any version on right click and copy the link download by using wget command 

cd /usr/share/java

find new war file which you downloaded version 

#restart your jenkins sudo systemctl start jenkins 

jenkins --version 

login in the jenkins severs check your jobs 

=========================================================================


sudo yum list java*  # to upgrade the java --version 

select any one of the version and give yum install <selecte version> -y

yum list installed java*  #to check 



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------CD------------------------------------------------------

After builld the war file we have to deploy in any application serever like "TOMCAT"

Create one Ec2 instance if (amazon linux 2) ----note : if you choose linux 2023 commands will different)

Need to install java

for java 11
sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11

for java 17
sudo yum install java-17-amazon-corretto.x86_64



################  Tomcat  #########

#Install tomcat 

wget url https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.83/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.83.tar.gz

#untar  tar -xvzf <apachetomcat-tarfile>


#Rename it if required   mv <apachetomcat-tarfile> tomcat

tomcat/bin -----sh startup.sh   --to start
                sh shutdown.sh  -- to stop
 
#to change port number ------ /conf/server.xml

war file should place in -------------/tomcat/webapps 

#####################################################
custom manager app tomcat --------find / -name context.xml

----after finding the file need to open with vi

example -- vi /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

add comment it below two line <!--     -->
 ex: <!--  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
     allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->

#########################################################
username and password to login

cd tomcat/config/tomcat-user.xml 

vi tomcat-users.xml and add custom username password

  <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
  <role rolename="manager-status"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status"/>
  <user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>




### Maven project Job: CICD deployer on Tomcat
step-1 need to configure Maven and jenkins paths in global tool configuration

/usr/share/maven                              #MAVEN_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-amazon-corretto.x86_64   #JAVA_HOME

step-2

plugin stageview
plugin maven
plugin Deployment container 

step-3:
Dashboard --->Manage Jenkins --->Credentials --->System -- >Global credentials (unrestricted)
need to configure credentials --username : deployer password deployer   :--- reference from ( <user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>)

step-4 create maven job and give git url for source code to build 

step-5 give build actions goals like test, install etc..

step-6 In postbuild actions select war/ear file to give path of War --path **/*.war 

step-7 we need to add container (tomcat) we have to give configured credentials of tomcat and give url of tomcat

webhook 
http://34.228.189.137:8080/github-webhook/

we have to give jenkins URL as payload url



"CI/CD----Maven job---Javaproject"
####pipelinejob:example

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('stage-1') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/CloudTechDevOps/project-1-maven-jenkins-CICD-docker-eks-.git'
            }
        }
   
        stage('clean') {
            steps {
              sh  'mvn clean'
            }
        }
        
        stage('test') {
            steps {
              sh  'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('install') {
            steps {
               sh  'mvn install'
            }
        }
        
        stage('deployment') {
            steps {
                
              deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: 'tomcat', path: '', url: 'http://100.26.194.72:8080/')], contextPath: null, war: 'webapp/target/*.war'

            }
        }
        
    }
}

Note : while generating the scrip we have to give path of ear/war file should be -- webapp/target/*.war  (# this is as per my project folder reference )



Why Only Jfrog
Jfrog Artifactory?
What is Artifact
what is artifact Repository?
why artifact Repository?
Type of packages it supports:
How to setup Artifactory server on AWS 
Artifact Deployment from maven to Jfrog
Artifactory Integration with jenkins

repository management tool
===========================
 - Repository management tools helps development teams create, maintain, and track their software packages.

Options
-------
1. Jfrog Artifact
2. Nexus
3. Apache Archiva
4. Nuget
5. github
6. s3

Why Only Jfrog
--------------
But jfrog supports wide range of formets and types.
Eg:- 
     python repo
     chef repo
     puppet repo
     Apt repo
     yum repo
     docker repo
     rpm repo
     maven repo...etc

- it is a repository management tool
- A universal artifact repository manager
- JFrog Artifactory is a repository manager that supports all available software package types
- Artifactory, the first-in-class binary repository management

Jfrog Artifactory?
==================
Jfrog Artifactory is a tool used in devops methodology to store artifacts (readily deployable code)

What is Artifact
----------------
The files that contain both compiled code and resources that are used to compile them are know as artifact. 
- They are readily deployable files.
								     	
- source code  -->  Build Tools  -->  Compilation  -->  Binary code -->  Dependencys/resources -->  Artifact

- in java an artifacts would be jar, war, ear...etc file
- in .net an artifacts would be .dll file


 								    	 
what is artifact Repository?
----------------------------
- An artifact repository is a repository which can store multiple different versions of artifacts.each
  time the war or tar.gz file is created. it stored in a server dedicated for the artifacts.


in real-time in the above process if you have any error in test env, we will rollback to version control to fix it. instead of that if you store artifacts in repo we can rollback to prevision version.

       -------------------------------------------------- #### ARTIFACTORY TOOL ####------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Artifactory is a universal DevOps solution for hosting, managing, and distributing binaries and artifacts. Any type of software in binary form – such as application installers, container images, libraries, configuration files, etc. – can be curated, secured, stored, and delivered using Artifactory.



Why Only Jfrog
Jfrog Artifactory?
What is Artifact
what is artifact Repository?
why artifact Repository?
Type of packages it supports:
How to setup Artifactory server on AWS 
Artifact Deployment from maven to Jfrog
Artifactory Integration with jenkins

repository management tool
===========================
 - Repository management tools helps development teams create, maintain, and track their software packages.

Options
-------
1. Jfrog Artifact
2. Nexus
3. Apache Archiva
4. Nuget
5. github
6. s3

Why Only Jfrog
--------------
But jfrog supports wide range of formets and types.
Eg:- 
     python repo
     chef repo
     puppet repo
     Apt repo
     yum repo
     docker repo
     rpm repo
     maven repo...etc

- it is a repository management tool
- A universal artifact repository manager
- JFrog Artifactory is a repository manager that supports all available software package types
- Artifactory, the first-in-class binary repository management

Jfrog Artifactory?
==================
Jfrog Artifactory is a tool used in devops methodology to store artifacts (readily deployable code)

What is Artifact
----------------
The files that contain both compiled code and resources that are used to compile them are know as artifact. 
- They are readily deployable files.
								     	
- source code  -->  Build Tools  -->  Compilation  -->  Binary code -->  Dependencys/resources -->  Artifact

- in java an artifacts would be jar, war, ear...etc file
- in .net an artifacts would be .dll file


 								    	 
what is artifact Repository?
----------------------------
- An artifact repository is a repository which can store multiple different versions of artifacts.each
  time the war or tar.gz file is created. it stored in a server dedicated for the artifacts.


in real-time in the above process if you have any error in test env, we will rollback to version control to fix it. instead of that if you store artifacts in repo we can rollback to prevision version.

 How to setup Artifactory server on AWS 
---------------------------------------

1. Pre-requisites:
   An AWS T2.medium (4GB RAM)EC2 instance (Linux)
   Open port 8081 and 8082 in the security group

wget https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/artifactory-rpms/artifactory-rpms.repo -O jfrog-artifactory-rpms.repo;

sudo mv jfrog-artifactory-rpms.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/;

sudo yum update && sudo yum install jfrog-artifactory-oss

systemctl start artifactory.service

systemctl status artifactory.service


     http://<PUBLIC_IP_Address>:8081

After Login we need to Provide 

Username as admin
Password as password 

#Note:we have to change it password after loggedin



########## APPROACH-1 #########

Artifact Deployment from maven to Jfrog without jenkins 
=======================================

1. Add Deployment element to maven pom.xml file.
 <distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>central</id>
        <name>NareshIT</name>
        <url>http://34.238.157.19:8081/artifactory/naresh-repo</url>
    </repository>
    <snapshotRepository>
        <id>central</id>
        <name>NareshIT</name>
        <url>http://34.238.157.19:8081/artifactory/naresh-repo</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>

2. Add Jfrog Credentials to apache-maven-3.8.6-->--conf-->settings.xml file.
	<servers>
	    <server>
      		<id>naresh</id>
      		<username>admin</username>
      		<password>naresh_123</password>
    	    </server>
	</servers>

3. Navigate to maven structure where pom.xml and src locates, and give below command.
    - mvn Deploy


###############APPROACH-2##########

Artifactory Integration maven integration with Jfrog by  using jenkins
=====================================

pre-requisites

A Artifactory server
A Jenkins Server

Integration Steps

Login to Jenkins to integrate Artifactory with Jenkins

1. Install "Artifactory" plug-in
     Manage Jenkins -> Jenkins Plugins -> available -> artifactory
2. Configure Artifactory server credentials
     Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Artifactory (or) Jfrog
3. Artifactory Servers
	Server ID : test
	URL : Artifactory Server URL (http://localhost:8081/)
	Username : admin
	Password : default password is "password" only. (login with default password later you can change)
        Test the connection




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Approach-3  (recomended)

step-1 Install Artifactory plugin 

       
step-2 Configure Artifactory server credentials
          Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Artifactory (or) Jfrog (Note: after configure serverID it will take care of URL and authentication of JFROG)
Step-3 create pipeline job


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('stage-1') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', credentialsId: 'terraform', url: 'https://github.com/nareshdevopscloud/project-maven-jenkins-CI-CD.git'
            }
        }
   
        stage('clean') {
            steps {
              sh  'mvn clean'
            }
        }
