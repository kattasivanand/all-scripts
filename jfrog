why artifact Repository?
Type of packages it supports:

- Artifactory, the first-in-class binary repository management

Jfrog Artifactory?
==================
Jfrog Artifactory is a tool used in devops methodology to store artifacts (readily deployable code)

What is Artifact
----------------
The files that contain both compiled code and resources that are used to compile them are know as artifact. 
- They are readily deployable files.
								     	
- source code  -->  Build Tools  -->  Compilation  -->  Binary code -->  Dependencys/resources -->  Artifact ---> Deploy

- in java an artifacts would be jar, war, ear...etc file
- in .net an artifacts would be .dll file


 								    	 
what is artifact Repository?
----------------------------
- An artifact repository is a repository which can store multiple different versions of artifacts.each
  time the war or tar.gz file is created. it stored in a server dedicated for the artifacts.


in real-time in the above process if you have any error in test env, we will rollback to version control to fix it. instead of that if you store artifacts in repo we can rollback to prevision version.

###:Jenkins:####

step-1 Install Artifactory plugin 

       
step-2 Configure Artifactory server credentials
          Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Artifactory (or) Jfrog (Note: after configure serverID it will take care of URL and authentication of JFROG)
          and give username and password.
Step-3 create pipeline job


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('stage-1') {
            steps {
               git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/CloudTechDevOps/project-1-maven-jenkins-CICD-docker-eks-.git'
            }
        }
   
        stage('clean') {
            steps {
